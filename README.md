# Levels Bot

## Initial Setup

Install Python 3.7.

Install libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- Create a .env file and add the environment variables from envExample.txt.
- Run the script `python main.py`.
- If needed, copy contents from the created `levels.txt` file into TOS studies.

## TOS Usage

Notes on usage. TOS doesn't seem to allow labels for the lines so this doesn't have labels. You will probably have to uncheck `Fit studies` in the `Auto Scale Settings` because the candlesticks will look squished. Unfortunately, it seems like TOS will fit these instead of not fit them like the price level drawing tool.

- Create a new study.
- Edit the sources, which can be done by adding the study and then right clicking it.
- Add the content to the sources and save.
